# Project Rules

## Commit Guidelines
- All commit messages MUST be written in English
- Use Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): description`
- Valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Example: `feat(auth): add user login validation`

## Decision Making
- Always provide multiple implementation options (minimum 2-3)
- Clearly state which option I recommend and explain why
- Wait for explicit approval before implementing any changes

## Code Standards
- Write clean, self-documenting code without comments
- Code should be readable and intuitive on its own
- Avoid verbose implementations - write minimal code that solves the requirement

## Workflow
- Always ask for confirmation before making any file changes
- Present options clearly with pros/cons
- Explain reasoning behind recommendations

## Python Standards
- Always use `python3` instead of `python`
- Always use `pip3` instead of `pip`
