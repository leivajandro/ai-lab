# Development Rules

## Code Style
- Never add comments to code
- Write minimal, clean code without verbose implementations
- Focus only on code that directly contributes to the solution

## Response Format
- Always provide multiple implementation options (2-3 alternatives minimum)
- Clearly state your preferred option and explain why
- Wait for user confirmation before implementing any solution
- Never proceed with implementation without explicit user approval

## Commit Guidelines
- All commit messages must be in English
- Follow Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): description`
- Valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Example: `feat(notebooks): add transformer model training`
